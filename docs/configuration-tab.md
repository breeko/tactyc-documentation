The Tactyc configuration tab is a worksheet that you can include in your model to make input/output selection easier. This worksheet is a "form" that you will fill in to define your inputs and outputs. When this form is completed, you can simply upload your model, and check the **This model has a Tactyc configuration tab** option. Tactyc will automatically read this tab and be able to calculate and create your dashboard from here on.

## Step 1
** Download the Tactyc configuration tab ****and make sure to include it in your model (you can copy this tab into your Excel file). It may be easier to start off with the sample above so you can see how the *TACTYC* config tab was populated for that model as an example.

## Step 2

**  Fill the information in the tab for inputs and outputs. You'll be defining names for each and linking to cells in your model. Instructions for filling this form are included in the file [(see an example of a filled out Tactyc Configuration Tab here)](https://du0bb4gb9kg21.cloudfront.net/documentation/configuration-tab/AppleAug20_config.xlsx)

- Once uploaded, Tactyc will start analyzing the model. You will be automatically taken to your home screen while the model is being computed. Depending on the number of inputs, number of steps, your model's logic etc. this process could take up to a few minutes

    Once completed, the Tactyc status will change from **Analyzing** to **Completed.** That's it! Click on **Open** to open your Tactyc dashboard. Congrats on creating your first Tactyc!
