**The live dashboard is at the heart of Tactyc. It allows control of the underlying model in a simple and intuitive manner with sliders - while giving you access to more high-powered tools that are working under the hood**

**Input Sliders**

Input sliders allow you to control the model by sliding the the input range.

**Cases**

A combination of slider values can be saved into cases such as Low, Base, High etc. Each saved case can be activated by selecting it from from the **Case Drop Down** at the top of the slider panel

- Saved cases can also be referred to for side by side comparison in the **Cases Overview** page
- Cases can be deleted by loading the case first and then clicking on **Delete Case** at the bottom of the slider
- Every time a case is added or deleted, the entire Tactyc is automatically saved
- Note that there will **always be a Default** case in the Slider Panel that represents the input values in the Excel file at the time the Tactyc was created. The default case cannot be deleted.
